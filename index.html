    <h1>Meet Callie, <br> a countdown bot for Slack.
      <img id="doggo" src="img/corgigirl.png" alt="Callie, the calendar dog"/> </h1>
    <h3>Callie the Calendar Corgi keeps track of events, deadlines, and more for your team with a few simple commands. Arf!</h3>
    <div id="unordered-list">
      <!-- This div here is for the first unordered-list -->
      <p><strong>UPDATES</strong>: Callie was last updated on April 10th, 2017.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some countdowns saved with bad data were unreachable via slack commands. Those are fixed and
          working now.</li>
        <li>Scheduled reminders will also now delete events if they happened already or happen on the day
          of the reminder.</li>
        <li>Error messages are more verbose. Especially if you try saving a countdown with brackets.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      This is a one-man side project, so I appreciate the folks who have reached out via email to let me know
      when they've encountered any issues or bugs. Please continue to do so, and I'll work to keep Callie
      as consistent and reliable as possible.
    </p>
